# Invistico-Airline
Invistico is a leading fortune 500 corporation and one of the top airlines in the aviation sector.

For this project, we intend to explore survey results provided by customers of Invistico Airline (anonymized), and understand what causes customers to be satisfied or dissatisfied.

The insights allow the airline to determine whether they are improving their service with customer expectations.

This can help them understand better how specific service offerings are performing with regards to customer satisfaction.

Maintaining quality is also important in relation to costs. Mistakes are expensive, quality control and quality assurance help businesses to limit additional costs and reduce wastage by aiming to ensure that things are done correctly the first time.
